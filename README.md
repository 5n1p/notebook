# Notebook Theme

This is a new theme for [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/ 'Pelican') based on source code of [Bootstrap2 Theme](https://github.com/quack1/pelican-themes/tree/master/bootstrap2 'Bootstrap2 Theme') and the design/CSS of [Paul Rouget's site](http://paulrouget.com/ 'Paul Rouget').

It is designed to be very minimalistic, simple and clear. Yet, it is not responsive and adaptable to many browser sizes. It will be on a later update.

If you want to use/update it, please do it from the direct [project repository](https://github.com/quack1/notebook). It will be the most up-to-date repo.

This theme is published under the [New BSD License](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause). So, feel free to use/hack/redistribute it!
